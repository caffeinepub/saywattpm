  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses both requirements. REQ-18 (authentication fix) is implemented through the LoginButton component with proper error handling, state management, and user feedback. REQ-19 (landing page redesign) is fully implemented with a construction-themed hero section, feature highlights, responsive design, and proper routing logic. All acceptance criteria are met with evidence in the diff.",
